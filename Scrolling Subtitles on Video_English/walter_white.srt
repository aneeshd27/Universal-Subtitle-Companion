1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,500
 Who  are  you  talking  to  right  now?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,660
 Who  is  it  you  think  you  see?

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,759
 Do  you  know  how  much  I  make  a  year?

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,500
 I  mean,  even  if  I  told  you,  you  wouldn't  believe  it.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,280
 Do  you  know  what  would  happen  if  I  suddenly  decided  to  stop  going  into  work?

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,960
 A  business  big  enough  that  it  could  be  listed  on  the  NASDAQ  goes  belly  up.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
 Disappears.  It  ceases  to  exist  without  me.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,340
 You  clearly  don't  know  who  you're  talking  to,  so  let  me  clue  you  in.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,460
 I  am  not  in  danger,  Skyler.  I  am  the  danger.
